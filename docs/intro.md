# Introduction to TidyScreen

TidyScreen is a Python package developed at the Medicinal Chemistry Laboratory (MedChemLab ), which is part of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Chemical Sciences, National University of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. 

At MedChemLab we have been working for several years in the execution of virtual screening campaigns (VSC) in the search of new chemical entities that may constitute candidate as potentially usefull bioactive therapeutic compounds.

In our experience, while VSC constitutes fascinating scientific endevors, they can sometimes become overwhelming in respect to the ammount of information generated, requiring dedicated strategies for data management, analysis and storage. Also, VSC constitutes highly multidisciplinary research efforts, in which typically three main scientific domains "talks" to each one as the campaing advances.

For all these reasons, information related to a VSC needs to be generated in an easy and organized fashion. This is the main objective behind the development of TidyScreen, and we hope you find the package usefull and meeting your reserach objectivess

We will kingly appreaciate them!

## Installation

In order to install TidyScreen you need to have the [Conda](https://anaconda.org/) environment managers installed in your computer. It is highly recommendable to create a separate environment to install the package, which can be done as follows:

```bash
# Create a dedicated environment 
$ conda create -n tidyscreen python=3.10

# Activate the environment to install the package
$ conda activate tidyscreen

# Install the package from the project GitHub repository
$ pip install git+https://github.com/MedChemLab/TidyScreen_revised

```

If the above commandas runs successfully, all the packages and dependencies required to run TidyScreen functions will be available in the environment, and thus can be accessed as indicated in the tutorial provided.

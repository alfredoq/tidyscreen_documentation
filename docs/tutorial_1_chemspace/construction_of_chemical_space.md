# Construction of a working chemical space

The chemical space to be used in a vHTS campaign can be constructed using diverse methodological approaches, each one particularly adapted to the research objectives. Some of the alternatives are:

    - Compilation of commercially available compounds;
    - Retrieval of compounds libraries from databases such as [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/);
    - Exploration of in-house compounds libraries;
    - Exploration of synthetic chemical routes;
    - Etc...

In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the ***exploration of synthetic chemical routes*** since it is particularly powerful in the context of the triazole chemistry that we have commented as strategy in the previous section.
